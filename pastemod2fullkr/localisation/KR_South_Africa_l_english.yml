### Focuses ###
SAF_black_monday_crisis:0 "Recovery from Black Monday?"
SAF_black_monday_crisis_desc:0 "The economic crisis threatens to tear the Union apart. We must reform our country's economy to solve mass unemployment, but the Volksraad stands divided on the path to take forwards. This choice will certainly have repercussions in the years to come, and may even exacerbate existing divides."
SAF_representation_natives_act:0 "Representation of Natives Act"
SAF_representation_natives_act_desc:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act of 1936 will become the centrepiece of upcoming social and political reforms within the country. The original provisions will probably have to be altered significantly, however."
SAF_paramount_chiefs:0 "Establish the Paramount Chiefs"
SAF_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "Granting autonomy to the local rulers of the former HCTs will allow us to install new, autonomous Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland) loyal to the central government."
SAF_develop_provinces:0 "Develop the Protectorates"
SAF_develop_provinces_desc:0 "The crown protectorates are perhaps the least-developed regions in the Union - it is vital that we develop their infrastructure to maintain pace with the rest of the country."
SAF_develop_provinces_2:0 "Continue Developing the Protectorates"
SAF_develop_provinces_2_desc:0 "With the infrastructure of the protectorates developed, we can now focus on developing their industry - as well as the industry of the surrounding areas, for which the protectorates often serve as a source of cheap labour."
SAF_native_autonomy:0 "The Question of Native Autonomy"
SAF_native_autonomy_desc:0 "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the former High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs power - is it limited to within the borders of the former HCT or does it encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa?"
SAF_paramount_forces:0 "Forces of the Paramount Chiefs"
SAF_paramount_forces_desc:0 "Given the increased autonomy of the Paramount Chiefs, some of them are asking to be allowed to raise their own forces comprised of their respective tribesmen to better secure their own positions. While arming natives is an unpalatable prospect, it would reduce the strain upon the Union's armed forces."
SAF_askari_corps:0 "The South African Askari Corps"
SAF_askari_corps_desc:0 "Now that we have armed certain ethnic groups, hawks in the Volksraad are suggesting that we may as well raise our own native units, ones that would be loyal not to the Paramount Chiefs but to the Union."

SAF_new_resources_1:0 "Industrial Mining"
SAF_new_resources_1_desc:0 "Industrialisation continues at an impressive pace with new mines opening every month across the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. The roads of Johannesburg and Pretoria equal that of any European city. But there is discontent rising from the British provinces, who believe that our programme is unfairly weighted towards the Afrikaans speaking areas."
SAF_industrialization_1:0 "The Witwatersrand Basin"
SAF_industrialization_1_desc:0 "We have begun our efforts to further industrialise our nation. Through the entire Witwatersrand basin roads and railway tracks are being built and new steel mills constructed, bringing thousands back into the workforce."
SAF_shipbuilding_1:0 "Expand the Cape Dockyards"
SAF_shipbuilding_1_desc:0 "One obvious place we can develop our industry is in the shipbuilding sector of Cape Town - the dockyards are sorely in need of updating and expansion, and increasing their capacity will put a large number of people to work."
SAF_entente_help:0 "Seek Help from the Entente"
SAF_entente_help_desc:0 "In an effort to bring our economy back from the crash brought on by German trade dependence, the Dominion Party has suggested looking back towards the old empires for new trade opportunities. It is hoped that in so doing, British and French investment will create job opportunities for South Africa's unemployed."
SAF_foreign_investment:0 "Encourage Foreign Investment"
SAF_foreign_investment_desc:0 "Now that the Entente has normalised trade, the time has come to entice their investors to come to South Africa and help us in the industrialisation process."
SAF_new_resources_2:0 "Kimberley Mines"
SAF_new_resources_2_desc:0 "The influx of capital from the Entente continues to grow our economy. New mines have opened in Kimberley, but some members of the Gesuiwerde and even our own party have spoken out against the clear focus on British dominated parts of the country."
SAF_infrastructure_1:0 "Major Roadworks"
SAF_infrastructure_1_desc:0 "The Union is in dire need of better roads even in its southern territories. Luckily, we now have access to a lot of city labour ready to link up the Natal, Transvaal and Cape provinces."
SAF_new_resources_3:0 "Orange River Mines"
SAF_new_resources_3_desc:0 "Our improved infrastructure now allows us to exploit new ore veins on the Orange River. A transport hub is also to be constructed at Hopetown to help with the exploitation of the mineral riches."
SAF_military_factories:0 "Build Military Factories"
SAF_military_factories_desc:0 "It will take a large number of resources, but one way the government can put people to work is by investing in our military infrastructure. We have the natural resources to develop our military - now all we need is the will to make it matter."
SAF_recovery:0 "The South African Recovery"
SAF_recovery_desc:0 "Finally we are in a position to put Black Monday behind us once and for all. Let us move forward into an era of strength for the South African economy!"
SAF_industrial_focus:0 "Focus on Industry"
SAF_industrial_focus_desc:0 "With Black Monday behind us, our focus should be on our civilian industry - it is the backbone of our economy, and the primary way we'll keep people working."
SAF_military_focus:0 "Focus on the Military"
SAF_military_focus_desc:0 "With Black Monday behind us, our focus should be on our military infrastructure - this will keep South Africa strong, as well as keep the economy moving."
SAF_trade_focus:0 "Focus on Trade"
SAF_trade_focus_desc:0 "With Black Monday behind us, we should renew our efforts to keep trade going. Despite the wishes of some, we cannot cut ourselves off from the world. South Africa is a small country, in the bigger picture, and it relies on trade with larger nations to remain vital."

SAF_1938_elections:0 "The 1938 General Elections"
SAF_1938_elections_desc:0 "Scheduled to take place in May of 1938, the South African General Elections will probably be the most polarised our country has ever seen, with two radically different views of our country's future in play. The stakes are high, as whoever wins will choose the path forward, and there are no obvious favourites yet."

SAF_nationalist_victory:0 "National Party 'Victory'!"
SAF_nationalist_victory_desc:0 "The National Party has created enough of a coalition to be able to fundamentally hamper the new government in much of what it wishes to achieve. Whilst some may see this as just a sugar-coated loss, the National Party wishes to continue fighting against reform attempts as much and for as long as they can.."
SAF_african_gold:0 "South African Gold"
SAF_african_gold_desc:0 "South Africa's deposits of gold and diamonds are the envy of the world. It's time we nationalised many of these mines and used their profits to subsidise the government's efforts elsewhere."
SAF_develop_capital:0 "The Jewel of South Africa"
SAF_develop_capital_desc:0 "South African gold will fund the development of our glorious capital - an expansion of its industry, its infrastructure, and its defence. It is, after all, the beating heart of our nation."
SAF_expansionism:0 "New Expansionism"
SAF_expansionism_desc:0 "There is an attitude among many within our party that South Africa is a strong nation whose influence should not stop at our northern borders. Perhaps it is time we considered a more aggressive stance?"
SAF_northern_border:0 "The Northern Borderlands"
SAF_northern_border_desc:0 "We now cast our eyes northward - to ensure that we are well-defended, should enemies march south, but also perhaps to enforce a claim on territory which is, by any reasonable yardstick, our natural borders."
SAF_focus_inward:0 "Focus Inward"
SAF_focus_inward_desc:0 "The time is not right for us to look elsewhere - to tell it truthfully, we have only barely made it to this point without our nation flying apart at the seams. Let us focus on establishing order in our own house before looking to expand elsewhere."
SAF_push_for_unity:0 "A Push for Unity"
SAF_push_for_unity_desc:0 "Our nation is, in many ways, still sorely divided. We must make an effort to shore up our support and enforce order - even if that order is something which must be maintained by force."

SAF_dominion_victory:0 "Dominion Party Victory!"
SAF_dominion_victory_desc:0 "The decision has been made, and it is the Dominion Party which has emerged victorious from an incredibly contentious election. Now we must move forward with a mandate to not only return to the fold of the British Empire proper, but to reorganise the entire structure of the South African government."
SAF_implement_federation:0 "Implement the Federation"
SAF_implement_federation_desc:0 "While we have been calling ourselves the South African Federation for a while, we have not yet implemented all the reforms we needed to make that change official. With the country stabilised and our opposition beaten, we can now move and rewrite the Constitution. The Union is no more, but South Africa lives on."
SAF_natives_trust_act:0 "Natives Trust Act"
SAF_natives_trust_act_desc:0 "The Natives Trust Act provides for the existence of native-administrated tribal land, and grants a great deal of autonomy for them in addition to ensuring a minimum of 20 percent of state land must be marked as such. The former Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal keep at the minimum threshold, with that figure rising in the British states, and a majority of the High Commission Territories will be given over to be governed by established Paramount Chiefs."
SAF_reintegrate_empire:0 "Reintegrate to the Empire"
SAF_reintegrate_empire_desc:0 "Now that we have a firm grip on our internal politics we should seek to rectify one of our more embarrasing mistakes, and fully reintegrate back into the Empire."
SAF_the_restoration:0 "The Restoration"
SAF_the_restoration_desc:0 "As expected, the King-Emperor accepted our request. Now, we must formalise the role of our Governor-General, one of the more autonomous Governor-Generals in the empire, due to our relative isolation for a time."
SAF_qualified_franchise_act:0 "Qualified Franchise Act"
SAF_qualified_franchise_act_desc:0 "The Qualified Franchise Act requires all states use a derivative of the Cape Qaulified Franchise in their elections, to ensure native representation and integration into the political process of South Africa. Again, however, the extent this is implemented in the Afrikaner-dominant states is kept at the required minimum. Despite this, qualified franchise in the other states ensures that non whites of at least 'middle class' wealth and education are eligible. This is most prominent in the Cape, where the qualified franchise is the most inclusive and full adult suffrage is granted to the Coloured & Asiatic populations. The same is true in Natal for the Asiatics, with the second largest franchise in South Africa."
SAF_united_south_africa:0 "A United South Africa!"
SAF_united_south_africa_desc:0 "With the federal model fully implemented and our laws revised to make the natives a full and functional arm of our country, South Africa is now a truly united nation."
SAF_native_service:0 "Native Service"
SAF_native_service_desc:0 "Our native population serves as a large portion of our armed forces - but only in an enlisted capacity. Perhaps the time has come to expand their role, to not only improve our army's organisation ability but perhaps also to attract new recruits into a service that welcomes them rather than simply makes use of them."
SAF_found_RSAF:0 "Found the RSAF"
SAF_found_RSAF_desc:0 "The South African Air Service, prior to federation, was under-funded and not really considered an independent branch of the military. The talented young officer, Adolph Malan, has petitioned the government to request aid from our British allies in acquiring older planes to establish the new Royal South African Air Force."


SAF_update_army:0 "Update the Army"
SAF_update_army_desc:0 "Our ground forces must be a new priority, promoting those generals who can bring the greatest benefit and reforming their methods for the sake of the nation."
SAF_weltkrieg_relics:0 "Relics of the Weltkrieg"
SAF_weltkrieg_relics_desc:0 "Our infantry's equipment is old, very old. Most of it has seen service during the Weltkrieg, and some sets have even seen action during the First Boer War. We must equip our army with modern gear, or else we will not stand a chance in another war."
SAF_upgrade_artillery:0 "Modernise the Artillery"
SAF_upgrade_artillery_desc:0 "South Africa's artillery mostly dates from the Weltkrieg. We must modernise our artillery unless we wish our soldiers to be eviscerated without proper support."
SAF_q_corps:0 "Q Services Corps"
SAF_q_corps_desc:0 "The Q Services Corps will be the centralised authority responsible for the logistics and supply of the permanent army. It will handle the distribution of oil, rations, ammo and uniforms. The work ahead of them is great, for Africa is a huge and hostile continent."
SAF_army_production:0 "Centralise Army Supply"
SAF_army_production_desc:0 "We will be recruiting a large number of soldiers. Manpower is not enough, however - we need the ability to produce massive amounts of guns for them to be effective."
SAF_military_college:0 "South African Military College"
SAF_military_college_desc:0 "South Africa should have a military academy modelled on the lines of the Preußische Kriegsakademie. This will give us a professional officer corps loyal to the Union, and rich of the knowledge of European military academies."
SAF_call_for_recruits:0 "A Call for Recruits"
SAF_call_for_recruits_desc:0 "Our recruitment practices are outdated - it is time to revise them, and at the same time put out a new call for enlisted soldiers."
SAF_elite_force:0 "An Elite Force"
SAF_elite_force_desc:0 "We do not have the industrial capacity for a large or armoured force. Instead we must focus on keeping South Africa's army small yet well-equipped and well-trained. Size is not as important as quality!"
SAF_native_ncos:0 "Native NCO's"
SAF_native_ncos_desc:0 "While Natives are no stranger to serving in our nation's military, the efficiency of their units is often compromised by a lack of co-operation with the exclusively Afrikaner and British command. A campaign to promote Native NCOs should help better organise these units."
SAF_special_forces:0 "The SASF"
SAF_special_forces_desc:0 "Africa presents many extreme environments. Large, sprawling jungles. Endless deserts. Immense oceans surrounding it and wielding the world's trade. Huge, tropical rivers. We will need special divisions, ready to stop at nothing to escort our army forwards."
SAF_special_equip:0 "Advanced Infantry"
SAF_special_equip_desc:0 "Military advisers have been suggesting the creation of expert units of our best commandos, armed with the latest technology. They will be a shining example of all the Republic has to offer."
SAF_army_support:0 "Expand the Support Companies"
SAF_army_support_desc:0 "Africa is a treacherous land, and it is our military engineers, medics and maintenance companies that often keep entire units alive and on the move. However, as our army expands, so too must our support companies. They are the backbone of our operations, after all."
SAF_mobile_force:0 "A Mobile Force"
SAF_mobile_force_desc:0 "The quality of our forces do not matter half so much as their mobility. This is a new era. and tactics of encirclement and reach are far more vital to victory than ever before. This must be the focus on South Africa's military future."
SAF_mech_focus:0 "New Mechanised Divisions"
SAF_mech_focus_desc:0 "Mobility does not mean simply building tanks - there is also the question of mobilising our infantry units, by building mechanised transport which will get them to the front quickly."
SAF_armored_corps:0 "The Armoured Corps"
SAF_armored_corps_desc:0 "Designing tanks with the capacity to operate in African lands is no small task. One must not be fooled by the large prairies surrounding the Cape, those tanks will inevitably face desert and jungle as they advance northwards. European roads are far from here."
SAF_mech_production:0 "Natal Motorworks"
SAF_mech_production_desc:0 "All the research into armour will not help us at all if we are not able to build it - we must nationalise a prominent vehicle manufacturer and build it into the centre of our growing armoured production core."
SAF_mech_support:0 "Mechanised Support"
SAF_mech_support_desc:0 "Better vehicles are not enough. We must look to specialised units within our divisions whose primary purpose is to make our armour and mechanised forces more effective."
SAF_new_army:0 "The New Army"
SAF_new_army_desc:0 "After all our efforts, the mighty South African Army has been reborn as a force with which to be reckoned rather than one to be mocked for its backwardness."

SAF_update_air_force:0 "Commit to the Five-Year Plan"
SAF_update_air_force_desc:0 "Not long ago, we developed a Five-Year Plan for the modernisation and expansion of the South African air force. The government must publicly commit to not fall behind this schedule. Africa will take to the air."
SAF_hartbees:0 "Improve the Hawker Hartbees"
SAF_hartbees_desc:0 "The Hawker Hartbees we have are not the most advanced fighters in the world, but we will make do. Improved mechanics and training will get the most out of these biplanes until we finally get the opportunity to replace them."
SAF_blenheim:0 "Replace the Blenheim"
SAF_blenheim_desc:0 "The Bristol Blenheim has been a serviceable light bomber for our airforce, but it may be time to find something sturdier, with a longer range that can cover the African wastes and jungles."
SAF_air_school:0 "The School of Aviation"
SAF_air_school_desc:0 "The first step in rebuilding our air force is the creation of an air academy, one which can train our future airmen for the battles to come."
SAF_air_defense:0 "Increase Anti-Air Defences"
SAF_air_defense_desc:0 "Our focus should not only be on taking to the skies, but on increasing our defence against those who would take to the skies against us."
SAF_air_production:0 "Invest in Aviation"
SAF_air_production_desc:0 "Rebuilding our air force will require expanding and organising our factories for this sole purpose."
SAF_desert_air_force:0 "Desert Air Force"
SAF_desert_air_force_desc:0 "The desert skies are clear and the landscape forgiving, but the heat and sand means special attention is required to the mechanics of our aircraft. There are valuable skills to be learned in this unforgiving environment."
SAF_secure_cape:0 "Secure the Cape Sea Route"
SAF_secure_cape_desc:0 "Should the Suez Canal be blocked by conflict, the Cape will once again become the temporary gateway to the East. We must prepare to defend it at all costs from the navies of the great powers."
SAF_rule_the_skies:0 "Rule the Skies"
SAF_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "Our primary focus is on our air force - yes, this may come at the expense of our naval capabilities, but the Union must recognise where its strength lies and maximise its effectiveness."

SAF_tech_school:0 "Fund the Cape Town University"
SAF_tech_school_desc:0 "It is important to remember that scholarly pursuits are needed to maintain our position in Africa. Generous funding increases to the Cape Town University will allow us to educate the masses and become a beacon in a still-dark continent."
SAF_electronics_focus:0 "Focus on Electronics"
SAF_electronics_focus_desc:0 "New developments in the realm of electronics are quickly outpacing our ability to keep up, and yet we must."
SAF_state_security:0 "The Cryptology Division"
SAF_state_security_desc:0 "Computers are the new realm in gathering information - and we must organise our state security programs to remain on top of this new front."
SAF_radio_africa:0 "Radio South Africa"
SAF_radio_africa_desc:0 "The development of radio allows us a means of expanding our communication across all of South Africa like never before. We must open up a new organisation to keep the public informed, as well as to facilitate the organisation of our frontline units."
SAF_expand_tech:0 "Expand Research Capacity"
SAF_expand_tech_desc:0 "With Black Monday behind us, the time has come to expand our research facilities - lest we fall behind the rest of the world and doom ourselves to become the backwater they already believe we are."
SAF_rocketry_focus:0 "Rocket Engines"
SAF_rocketry_focus_desc:0 "The future lies in the development of rocket engines - both for our air force as well as for the development of new and powerful weapons that operate at a speed never before achievable."
SAF_advanced_refinery:0 "The Pretoria Refinery"
SAF_advanced_refinery_desc:0 "South Africa has few oil reserves - thus we must look to the development of synthetic oils if we are to have any hope of self-sufficiency."
SAF_new_minds:0 "New Minds, New Achievements"
SAF_new_minds_desc:0 "South Africa has become a great power in the world. We must assemble these new minds in our universities and put them to work advancing our nation."

SAF_seaward_defense:0 "Seaward Defence Force"
SAF_seaward_defense_desc:0 "The Seaward Defence Force has served as our navy for two decades. Even as the crisis consumes our country, we should increase its funding. The Cape has always been vulnerable to attack without it and the protection of the British."
SAF_naval_academy:0 "The Cape Town Naval Academy"
SAF_naval_academy_desc:0 "It is not enough simply to have ships in our fleet - we must train our captains and admirals in the newest methods of naval warfare, to make each one of our vessels worth three of our enemy's."
SAF_submarine_focus:0 "Submarine Focus"
SAF_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Submarines are an excellent way to disrupt enemy convoys. We should construct as many as possible."
SAF_destroyer_focus:0 "Destroy Focus"
SAF_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Destroyers are effective at destroying enemy submarines. We should ensure our shipping is safe by constructing as many of these as possible."
SAF_expand_simons_town:0 "Expand the Simon's Town Base"
SAF_expand_simons_town_desc:0 "Simon's Town on the Cape has been the most important naval base in southern Africa since the 1790s. It should be refitted and expanded to accommodate more and larger vessels."
SAF_navy_production:0 "Improve Shipbuilding Techniques"
SAF_navy_production_desc:0 "The shipbuilding facilities in Cape Town are sorely out of date. They must be updated and expanded, ready to expand our South African fleet."
SAF_overseas_offensive:0 "Expand Overseas Capability"
SAF_overseas_offensive_desc:0 "Powerful battleships will make sure our naval superiority is permanent, and that we are able to project our power well beyond our borders."
SAF_cape_garrison:0 "Strengthen the Cape Garrison"
SAF_cape_garrison_desc:0 "The Cape Garrison guns must be upgraded and increased to protect the Cape from enemy attack. No enemies shall set a foot on the Cape!"
SAF_rule_the_seas:0 "Rule the Seas"
SAF_rule_the_seas_desc:0 "Our primary focus is on our navy - yes, this may come at the expense of our air capabilities, but the Union must recognise where its strength lies and maximise its effectiveness."

### Ideas ###

SAF_black_monday_1:0 "Effects of Black Monday"
SAF_black_monday_1_desc:0 "Black Monday has struck our country harshly due to our dependence on German trade. Unrest is growing and our economy falters, we must find ambitious solutions to this problem, and quickly!"

SAF_segregation_1_desc:0 "South Africa is a divided nation. While the vast majority of the population belongs to the various native ethnic African groups, socio-economic power is held by the white European minority. This in turn is divided between the Afrikaners, Dutch-speaking descendants of the original Dutch colonists and the Boers who settled the Transvaal and Orange Free State, and the British who form the majority of the white population in Natal and Rhodesia."

saf.1.t:0 "The Union of South Africa"
saf.1.d:0 "Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa - the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State - the Union of South Africa is currently a parliamentary dominion, having weathered the troubles of the 1925 crisis with relative ease. The British Revolution caused temporary military chaos in british southern Africa, though quickly resolved with the loyal Southern Rhodesia voting to unify with South Africa - with a tacit understanding that Northern Rhodesia and Nyassaland were to be abandoned, and only Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland being retained.\nThe Governor-General Jan Smuts, with the blessing of the King-Emperor, has maintained his popularity with a combination of the increased pro-Dominion vote garnered in the new lands and a soaring popularity from holding together the Union in the '25 Crisis. However, with the economy inexorably tied to that of its new northern neighbour, the frankenstein amalgamation Germany christened 'Mittelafrika', South Africa's economy is effectively split between the sphere of the Entente and Germany. This is seen by some as a blessing, as it's meant we've kept out of the worst of the depression that the rest of the empire has seen, but if anything were to happen to Germany, we would feel it far worse than our allies"
saf.1.a:0 "Union is Strength"
saf.2.t:0 "The Union's Constitution"
saf.2.d:0 "South Africa's current constitution is based on the 1909 South Africa Act. The Union of South Africa is a unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils. The Parliament consists of two parts: the House of Assembly/Volksraad and Senate. The House of Assembly's members are elected mostly by the country's white minority, although the franchise varies depending upon the province. In the Cape and Natal, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place, while the vote is white-only everywhere else. The Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. Government follows the Westminster model, and unlike its compatriots the South African system is non-federal. South Africa continues to administer Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland as protectorates, and while considerable legislation is in place restricting the rights of the native population within the Union, it has not been fully implemented in these territories."
saf.2.a:0 "I see"
saf.3.t:0 "The Black Monday hits South Africa"
saf.3.d:0 "A week ago, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. South Africa has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution and the emergency dealings with Mittelafrika, and a sharp decrease trade with the remaining members of the Entente.\n\nThe crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market have gone out of business or laid off white workers in favour of cheaper native labour."
saf.3.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
saf.4.t:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
saf.4.d:0 "The global economic crisis has hit South Africa hard, leaving our economy in tatters and bringing our institutions to the brink of a full political crisis. Our dependence on trade with Germany, necessary as it may have seemed at the time, has come back to bite us.\nThe House of Assembly is divided on how best to deal with the crisis; both major parties are pointedly ignoring the dependance on German trade that began this, as the National Party is vehemently pro-German and the Dominionist Party were the party to ramp up the trade in the first place.\n\nCheap black and coloured labour is seen by many as the chief cause of unemployment, and both the National Party and Labour Party are calling for further restrictions to be made on native employment. The National Party also believes an ambitious works programme and an exploitation of the Protectorates could alleviate the situation, while Labour feels socio-economic reform is key to solving the crisis.\n\nThe Dominion Party's coalition believes that this is a good opportunity to fully reorient back with the Entente, now that there is seemingly no advantage to continuing the exessive German trade."
saf.4.a:0 "The Dominion Party will solve this crisis alone"
saf.4.b:0 "Work with our the Progressives and Liberals, exclude the Nationalists"
saf.4.c:0 "Work with all major parties, even the Nationalists"
saf.5.t:0 "The National Party Splits"
saf.5.d.coalition_labour:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject the current government's compromise with socialists, and believe the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system termed 'apartheid'. They have already gained noticeable support among the Afrikaner population, though it seems unlikely they will be a real factor in the coming election."
saf.5.d.coalition_dominion:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They utterly reject the current government's compromise with the British, and believe the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system termed 'apartheid'. They have already gained noticeable support among the Afrikaner population, though it seems unlikely they will be a real factor in the coming election."
saf.5.d.reforms:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They utterly reject the current government's softening stance on issues of racial segregation, and believe the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system termed 'apartheid'. They have already gained noticeable support among the Afrikaner population, though it seems unlikely they will be a real factor in the coming election."
saf.5.a:0 "This is madness!"
saf.7.t:0 "Grand Coalition Dissolves"
saf.7.d:0 "The National Party had pledged to help the government deal with the current economic crisis - but, as part of that, they expected a number of radical reforms to the country's racial segregation policies...reforms which, they say, haven't materialised. Indeed, the government has ignored every recommendation of their Nationalist allies. Thus the coalition has broken apart, and National leaders have renewed their intention to see the Dominion Party defeated in the upcoming election."
saf.10.t:0 "The Representation of Natives Act"
saf.10.d:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis, the Representation of Natives Act was intended to expand a series of rights to the coloured and black populations by increasing the central government's control in enforcing laws in the provinces (specifically targeted at the majority afrikaner provinces). This would be done by attempting to force at least minor representation in the Senate from the black/coloured population in the afrikaner provinces by allowing them to elect a small amount of whites to represent them (via a system of block voting).\n\nHowever, in this new political climate, the new extremist breakaway of the National Party is ramping up a propaganda campaign against our efforts, and seeing some success - promoting their viewpoint as being anti-central government overreach, rather than racially based. In turn, a compromise has also been suggested: the establishment of a Native Representative Council, which would keep natives politically separate from whites, but would allow them an advisory role detached from actual representation."
saf.10.a:0 "Pass the original proposal"
saf.10.b:0 "Establish the Native Representation Council as a compromise"
saf.11.t:0 "The Extent of Native Autonomy"
saf.11.d:0 "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the former High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland amd the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs' power - is it limited to within the borders of the former HCT, or does it encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa?"
saf.11.a:0 "Their authority stops at the border"
saf.11.b:0 "They will fully represent their people"
saf.15.t:0 "Rewiring trade with South Africa?"
saf.15.d:0 "We have been contacted by the South African government who, with the Berlin collapse, have found themselves as destitute as us. Seeing an opportunity, with the drawbacks functionally removed, they've requested full resumption of imperial trade. How should we respond?"
saf.15.a:0 "Back into the fold!"
saf.16.t:0 "Rewiring trade with South Africa"
saf.16.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has decided to normalise trade relations with South Africa, owing to the dominion's recent economic crisis and almost certainly at their request. [From.GetNameDefCap] has asked that [Root.GetNameDef] follow suit, to encourage investors from across the Empire and wider Entente in seeking out South African opportunities."
saf.16.a:0 "Came back with their tail between their legs, hmm?"
saf.17.t:0 "The Canadians Agree!"
saf.17.d:0 "The Canadians have agreed to re-open relations with us, and to re-open free trade with us. Other Entente nations are almost certainly to now follow suit!"
saf.17.a:0 "Hurrah!"
saf.25.t:0 "The Port Elizabeth Declaration"
saf.25.d:0 "Today in Port Elizabeth, the leading figures of the Dominion Party, Governor-General Jan C Smuts and Jan Hofmeyer, along with the provincial governors of the Cape, Natal and Rhodesia met to discuss the coming election in May. An agreement has been reached, based on seeing the plight of the non-whites and the constant verbal attacks thrown at them in the Senate by Nationalist politicians, to issue a deceleration; that their intent is to reform the Union of South Africa into a new more liberal Federation and to pursue a  general reconciliation with the non-whites."
saf.25.a:0 "Hmmm..."
saf.26.t:0 "The 1938 General Elections"
saf.26.d:0 "The 1938 Union of South Africa General Elections have clearly transformed into a referendum on the country's future. Nobody believes that the Nationalists will gain power, however they are building a strong coalition (due to dissention from supporters of other parties at the Port Elizabeth Declaration) to hopefully combat the government's attempts at reform. Or, the Dominion Party will retain its strong position and begin enaction of their reforms, much to the horror of many on the far-right.\n\nIn what is likely to become one of the most important elections in the nation's history, tensions are running high as reports of violent incidents throughout the country increase with each passing day."
saf.26.a:0 "The National Party topples the Dominionists' majority!"
saf.26.b:0 "The Dominion Party retains their majority!"
saf.27.t:0 "The Nationalist Government"
saf.27.d:0 "The National Party has faced off with the seemingly all-powerful Dominion Party and come out not empty handed. Hours from the inaugural speech of the Prime Minister, Hertzog declared that he will 'Fight the King of the Blacks with all I have!' - 'King of the Blacks' being their new slogan for describing Smuts."
saf.27.a:0 "Fight the good fight!"
saf.28.t:0 "The Dominionist Government"
saf.28.d:0 "The Dominion Party has retained its majority in power and now wishes to implement a smooth and peaceful transition to a more fair rule. Though the Nationalists are seemingly quashed for now, there are multiple counts of 'revenge' lynchings and attacks on non-whites in the Afrikaner provinces. In lieu of this rise in political violence, it may be prudent to wait a while before beginning the transition in earnest"
saf.28.a:0 "No, we will not wait to create the Federation"
saf.28.b:0 "Perhaps waiting two years is for the best"
saf.30.t:0 "Gesuiwerde Rejoins the National Party"
saf.30.d:0 "Mollified by our full implementation of apartheid, Daniel François Malan and his fellow hard-liners have agreed to rejoin the government. Not everyone is thrilled by their return, though this does effectively make South Africa a one-party state, since the Afrikaner population is unlikely to support any other party in great numbers. Future elections will mostly be simply for show."
saf.30.a:0 "Good news, I think"
saf.31.t:0 "The National Party Splits"
saf.31.d:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject the current government's moderate approach towards the implementation of apartheid, and they have already gained considerable support among the Afrikaner population. It's entirely possible they could pose a threat in future elections."
saf.31.a:0 "We'll need to watch them closely"
saf.35.t:0 "The South African Federation"
saf.35.d:0 "The old unitary structure of South Africa has been replaced by a federal model - the five old provinces (Cape, Natal, the Orange Free State, Transvaal, and Rhodesia) have been joined by the three High Commission Territories of Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Swaziland to form the eight states of the Federation. The states have their own legislatures and premiers with considerable powers over socio-economic policy within the state, but there are limits imposed by the central federal government based in Cape Town: the major ones are the Natives Trust Act and the Qualified Franchise Act, both of which have yet to be passed by the House of Assembly. Needless to say, neither will be popular with the white Afrikaner population."
saf.35.a:0 "Long live the Federation!"
saf.36.t:0 "South Africa wishes to reintegrate with the Empire"
saf.36.d:0 "The government of the South African Federation has announced recently that they wish to fully return to the fold. It's a rather sudden, but expected move, as the reelection of the Dominion Party and the ripping away of German investment leaves this as being the only route South Africa could take. Still, the Empire growing tighter isn't to be frowned at."
saf.36.a:0 "For King and Empire!."
saf.37.t:0 "We reintegrate to the Empire!"
saf.37.d:0 "Our King-Emperor has, as we expected, welcomed our request to come fully back into the fold. Onwards South Africa, Onwards with the Empire!"
saf.37.a:0 "This time we will win!"
saf.39.t:0 "The Restoration"
saf.39.d:0 "Now that we're comfortably settled back in the imperium, a debate has sparked as to the role of the Governor-General. More and more, the beloved old General effectively held the helm of state, and so some are calling for this agreement to be formalised - as in, that he can act as South Africa's legal representative semi-autonomously. However, there is also an argument to be made for the full restoration of the King-Emperor, even though that may anger both the Afrikaner and more liberal-minded of our population."
saf.39.a:0 "Legally establish our Governor-General as pseudo-Head of State"
saf.39.b:0 "Reforge ties with our King-Emperor"
saf.50.t:0 "Construction of the Voortrekker Monument"
saf.50.d:0 "Begun in 1935, the construction of the Voortrekker Monument is nearing completion. Situated in Pretoria, it commemorates the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854 to found the Afrikaner Republics of the interior. Costs, however, continue to grow, but we are on schedule to open the Monument at the Centenary celebrations next year."
saf.50.a:0 "It will be a lasting legacy!"
saf.51.t:0 "Preparations for the Centenary Celebrations"
saf.51.d:0 "The Centennial Anniversary of the Great Trek is little under a month away. The centenary celebrations are planned to commence with a re-enactment of the trek, beginning on 8 August 1938 with nine ox wagons departing from the the statue of Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and ending at the newly completed Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, at which point the monument shall be inaugurated by the President.\n\nThe whole affair is meant to be a celebration of Afrikaner culture and heritage, but the situation in the country has since changed, and such a lavish event could very well be met with open hostility by the other racial groups and even the pro-British population who are likely to see it as a display of Afrikaner triumphalism. Shall we continue as planned or adopt a more modest approach?"
saf.51.a:0 "It will go ahead as planned!"
saf.51.b:0 "Perhaps a more modest approach is best"
saf.52.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
saf.52.d.national:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. While the ceremony proceeded without incident, the atmosphere was of a subdued nature in Cape Town as the reenactment departed."
saf.52.d.dominion:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. The ceremony was lacklustre, the poor funding self-evident. This was offset, however, by the large turnout of Afrikaners from other parts of South Africa, including a group calling themselves the Ossewabrandwag (Ox-Wagon Sentinels). Unfortunately this militia-of-sorts clashed with local police, who struggled to handle the larger than expected crowds. With violence escalting, the police tried to halt the procession and disperse the re-enactors, which resulted in shots being exchanged. Three policemen and 17 Ossewabrandwag were killed, and many more re-enactors and bystanders were injured."
saf.52.a:0 "Could have been worse..."
saf.52.b:0 "Oh Dear!"
saf.53.d.national:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life, land, and liberty free from British domination. Unfortunately, large numbers of British and Coloureds protested the ceremony, with several attempts being made to impede the procession until police finally cleared a path by force. One of the wagons was destroyed, however, and several of the participants injured."
saf.53.d.dominion:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life, land, and liberty free from British domination. While the ceremony proceeded without incident, the atmosphere was severely strained in Cape Town as the re-enactment departed."

saf.54.t:0 "Inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
saf.54.d.national:0 "The re-enactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town two weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that unity was needed in these troubled times to preserve the Union of South Africa. The ceremony was a more reserved affair than many had expected, but the lack of any hostilities in response was a welcome relief for the government."
saf.54.d.dominion:0 "The re-enactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town two weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Smuts addressed the crowd, stating that unity was needed and that the rights of the Afrikaner community would be respected as we moved towards federalism. The ceremony was an overall success, despite fringe protests by the Afrikaner Broederbond and other nationalist groups."
saf.54.a:0 "Hurrah!"

saf.79.d:0 "The Dominionist Party campaigned to restore the monarchy to South Africa and to reform the country into a new federation. Now that these goals have been achieved, ideological differences are beginning to fracture the party, with Hofmeyer's Progressives who seek to pursue a more liberal line in government, using federal powers to expand the franchise & social reform even further, and the Conservatives, still headed for now by Smuts. The Conservatives feel that the current reform of South Africa is sufficient and are reluctant to further encroach upon states rights and do not wish the franchise expanded further. While these factions will continue to govern in coalition, the look set to form their own independent political parties in time to contest the next general elections, at which point the Dominionist Party would cease to exist."
saf.79.a:0 "Okay, then..."
saf.90.t:0 "The [GetYear] South Africa General Election"
saf.90.d:0 "According to [Root.GetNameDef]'s constitution, the elections are to be held every five years. The National Assembly & Senate's terms have expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament.

It has established branches across much of South Africa, and formed the first black African trade union in the country, the Industrial Workers of Africa, in September 1917. It also formed a number of other unions amongst people of colour. While its founders were mainly drawn from the radical wing of the white working class, the movement would develop a substantial black African, Coloured and Indian membership. While the South African Labour Party has remained apart from the ISL due to its multi-racial policies more radical members push for a reconciliation. In the meanwhile, the SACP and its affiliates in the ANC campaign for political reform in South Africa and organise resistance to the worst excesses von Göring commits against the native population in the Freistaat."
